Rock-paper-scissors can be used to study decision-making and human behavior.
Rock-Paper-Scissors in Java
 * Core Idea:
   * A game where two players choose one of three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
   * Rock beats Scissors.
   * Scissors beats Paper.
   * Paper beats Rock.
   * If both players choose the same, it's a draw.
 * Java Implementation:
   * Use an enum to represent the choices: ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS.
   * Write logic to compare player choices and determine the winner.
   * Get player input and display the result.
In essence, it involves:
 * Representing choices: Using an enum for clear and organized code.
 * Determining winner: Implementing rules like "Rock beats Scissors" in Java code.
 * Getting player input: Allowing players to enter their choices (e.g., using Scanner).
 * Displaying results: Showing the winner or a draw to the players.
This provides a basic understanding of how to implement Rock-Paper-Scissors in Java.
